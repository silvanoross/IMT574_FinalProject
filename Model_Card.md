Explore inventory data and determine how to best optimize operational levels. 

## Model Details
- Developed by Felix Zhao, Jack Ko, and Silvano Ross at the University of Washington in IMT 574.
- ARIMA Model - [Statsmodels ARIMA](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA.html)
- 

## Intended Use
- Our intended use is to be able to predict the error in demand forecast versus actual sales to help us better manage inventory levels to prevent understocking of items.
- The users of this model would be managers and inventory specialists in charge of ordering supplies for their stores. 

## Factors

## Metrics

## Evaluation Data

## Training Data

## Quantitative Analysis

### Ethical Considerations
- This model uses no real data and there is no possibility of a HIPPA violation. There are not even real store names. The biggest risk to humans would be potential job loss through using this model and getting incorrect predictions on how to adjust inventory.
